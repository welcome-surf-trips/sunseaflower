# sunseaflower-wp-theme
Sunseaflower.com Wordpress Theme.

Some details:
 1 - The premier section: it will be different cities, with different dates and locals. It doesn't not need to use Database access once it will be rarely updated. We can change on theme when necessary.

2 - This layout is for before the release of the movie. After the release of the movie, it needs to be changed a little bit, the movie will have more focus than the trailler, of course, and premiere dates will be removed. I will pass this other PSD later.

3 - Logos on footer could be changed, so create this areas in a flexible way, to future changes.

4 - Banner needs to be flexible to change/updated it.

5 - When the user submit to the newsletter, it will be show a simple message. I will provide the message and the design/font used.
